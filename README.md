# Alpaca GraphQL JavaScript SDK

> [Alpaca Travel](https://alpaca.travel) offers an SDK to assist developers
> with building travel applications and websites.

Alpaca Travel offer an extensive managed GraphQL API that developers can easily
integrate into their applications and websites. The JavaScript SDK provides a
onboarding approach for developers that may want to leverage a simple SDK
oppposed to developing their own queries and mutations with GraphQL directly.

Our SDK's are based on Typescript and setup to work on basic GraphQL based
queries and mutations. We offer several versions of client in order to suit
preferences of developers.
