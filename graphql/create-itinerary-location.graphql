# Itinerary Location usually wraps a "place", in which each place created must
# supply a position coordinate (e.g. lon lat). Places can also reference further
# information that exists in a platform, such as common Id's. The Location can
# then be sequenced in an itinerary to represent the movement of a user or their
# bookmarks for an itinerary.
